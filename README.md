# Simple Artificial Neural Network ðŸ§ 

This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras to predict **customer churn** (whether a customer will leave a bank) based on structured tabular data such as credit score, age, balance, and account activity.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To classify whether a customer is likely to exit the bank (churn) based on personal and account information. This is a classic supervised binary classification problem.
